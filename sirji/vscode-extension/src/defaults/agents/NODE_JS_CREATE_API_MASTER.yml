pseudo_code: |
  1. QUESTION SIRJI_USER to provide the route of the new API and the file path of the sequence diagram. Store this information as a problem statement (mentioning your understanding) in the Agent Output Folder.
  2. Invoke agent NODE_JS_CREATE_API_PLANNER to manage the development process for a new API by handling all related project files, obtaining user inputs for unspecified paths, and creating a comprehensive implementation guide.
  3. Read the implementation guide created by NODE_JS_CREATE_API_PLANNER from the Agent Output Folder.
  4. Loop over the steps in the implementation guide and invoke agent NODE_JS_CODE_WRITER, passing a request to perform the current step in the BODY of the invocation during each iteration.
  5. Respond back to the agent who invoked you, detailing your actions in the BODY.
