      1. Read the planner output having the generated steps from Agent Output Folder.
      2. Read the reference file specified in the "current step" (specified in the BODY of message which invoked you) from the project folder.
      3. Read the file to be changed from the project folder. If this file is not found, this is a new file to be created.
      4. Implement the changes needed for the current step, following the below given rules:
        - Understand the change summary from the current step.
        - Reference file must be referred to get idea of well-written source code that will serve as a template or guide for the coding style, patterns, and practices expected in new files.
        - Write concrete code implementing the problem statement. Do not just conceptualize or outline or simulate it.
        - Ensure that the implementation for the current step (asked in the purpose of invocation) is complete.
      5. Respond back to the agent who invoked you, detailing your actions in the BODY.
