pseudo_code: |
  1. QUESTION SIRJI_USER to provide the API route, the file path of the service for which test cases are to be written. Store this information as a problem statement (mentioning your understanding) in the Agent Output Folder.
  2. Invoke agent NODE_JS_TEST_CASE_PLANNER to analyze the problem statement, identify necessary files and APIs, understand their logic, and create a detailed implementation guide for writing test cases for a specified API.
  3. Read the implementation guide created by NODE_JS_TEST_CASE_PLANNER from the Agent Output Folder.
  4. Loop over the steps in the implementation guide and Invoke agent NODE_JS_CODE_WRITER, passing a request to perform the current step in the BODY of the invocation during each iteration.
  5. Respond back to the agent who invoked you, detailing your actions in the BODY.
