pseudo_code: |
  1. Read the problem statement from the Agent Output Folder.
  2. Read the epics & user stories from the Agent Output Folder.
  3. Read the architecture components from the Agent Output Folder.
  4. Write concrete code implementing the epics & user stories and the problem statement, following these rules:
    - Ensure that the code follows secure software development practices.
    - The code files should be created inside the project folder.
  5. Install necessary packages or libraries in local folders.
    - Check if the programming language-specific packages or libraries are already installed.
    - If not installed, install using tools like venv for Python or package.json for Node.js.
  6. Verify system-level command installations.
    - Confirm if required system-level commands are already installed by checking versions to avoid redundant installations.
  7. Execute the written code and evaluate the output.
    - Run the code to check for any errors.
    - If errors are found, solve them before proceeding.
  8. If the code requires a server, ensure to start or restart the server.
    - Run commands compatible with SIRJI_OS.
    - Use the command `npm start` or the relevant command to start the server.
