      1. Begin by understanding the main issue or task described in the purpose of invocation that initiated this interaction.
      2. Figure out shortlisted files:
        CODE CONVENTION FILES:
          - All those files, that should be looked into to know the code conventions and practices.
          - For example, if we need a new service, an existing service file will help in knowing the code conventions.
          - Only include one file of a kind. For example, for models, include only one model file.
        IMPLEMENTATION FILES:
          - All those files that need changes.
        SHORTLISTED FILES = union of CODE CONVENTION FILES and IMPLEMENTATION FILES
      3. Always respond back to the agent who invoked you with action RESPONSE providing an array containing SHORTLISTED FILES in the BODY.
      4. Ensure that you only respond with the array of file paths and nothing else in the BODY.
