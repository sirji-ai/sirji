## Sirji

Sirji is a Visual Studio Code extension that works as an AI software development agent.

It is a virtual software developer that includes individual agents for planning, coding, researching, and executing projects.

Sirji solves users’ problem statements ranging from a new greenfield project to an existing brownfield project where it enhances existing code, fixes bugs, and writes test cases.

The extension leverages the capabilities of VS Code, including the Editor, Terminal, and Project Explorer.

It provides an interactive chat interface through which users submit their problem statements, answer questions, and provide feedback to Sirji.

Additionally and most importantly, Sirji sets up your local development environment by installing system-level packages as well as programming language-specific dependencies. It later executes the generated code in your local development environment.

## Prerequisites

Sirji has been tested on **macOS** only for now. We know there are certain OS-specific functionalities that we will soon generalize.

Make sure you have installed all of the following prerequisites on your machine:

- Visual Studio Code (>= 1.80.2)
- Node.js (>= 18) and npm (>= 8.19)
- Python (>= 3.10) - Make sure `python --version` runs without error.
- tee command - Make sure `which tee` runs without error.

Also, you will need an OpenAI API key to access the GPT-4 Turbo model.

## Installation

You can start using Sirji by installing this [extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TrueSparrow.sirji) from the Visual Studio Marketplace.

## Architecture

Sirji gets the work done using it's following agents:

- The **Planning Agent** takes a problem statement and breaks it down into steps.
- The **Coding Agent** proceeds step by step through the generated steps to solve the problem programmatically.
- The **Research Agent** utilizes RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and gets trained on URLs and search terms. It can later use this acquired knowledge to answer questions posed by the Coding Agent.
- The **Executor Agent** is responsible for Filesystem CRUD, executing commands, and installing dependencies. The Executor Agent is implemented directly within the extension and is written in TypeScript.

### PyPI Packages

The Planning Agent, Coding Agent, and Research Agent are developed within the Python package [`sirji-agents`](https://pypi.org/project/sirji-agents/) (located in the `agents` folder of this monorepo). <a href="https://pypi.org/project/sirji-agents/"><img src="https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/sirji-agents.svg" alt="Sirji Agents on PyPI" height="15"></a>

Communication among these agents is facilitated through a defined message protocol. The Message Factory (responsible for creating, reading, updating, and deleting messages according to the message protocol) and the permissions matrix are developed in the Python package [`sirji-messages`](https://pypi.org/project/sirji-messages/) (located in the `messages` folder of this monorepo).<a href="https://pypi.org/project/sirji-messages/"><img src="https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/sirji-messages.svg" alt="Sirji Messages on PyPI" height="15"></a>

The tools for crawling URLs (converting them into markdowns), searching for terms on Google, and a custom logger are developed within the Python package [`sirji-tools`](https://pypi.org/project/sirji-tools/) (located in the `tools` folder of this monorepo). <a href="https://pypi.org/project/sirji-tools/"><img src="https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/sirji-tools.svg" alt="Sirji Tools on PyPI" height="15"></a>

All these packages are invoked by Python Adapter Scripts, which are spawned by the extension.
