```python
from sirji_tools import crawl_urls

urls = ['https://www.google.com', 'https://www.yahoo.com']

crawl_urls(urls, 'workspace/researcher')
```

### Search

Search tool will be used to search the information from the web pages based on the search terms provided.
It returns the list of URLs related to the search terms.

```python
from sirji_tools import search_for

search_term = 'python programming'

urls = search_for(search_term)
```

### Logger
